# XPRIZE Rainforest

Welcome to the XPRIZE Rainfores project page! Here's an overview of what this project is about.

## About the Project

XPRIZE Rainforest is a global five-year, $10 million competition that challenges teams to innovate rapid and autonomous technology to expedite the monitoring of biodiversity and data collection, enhancing our understanding of tropical rainforest ecosystems around the world. I personally developed the remote water sampling module and prototyped a range-extender. I was lucky to be 1 of 6 students (out of ~250) selected for the traveling team in the Semi-finals in Singapore and 1 of 4 selected to compete in the Amazon Rainforest for the Finals. During the competition I helped with field work and data analytics. Our team made it and recently competed in the [Finals in Brazil](https://www.iit.edu/news/team-led-illinois-tech-professor-returns-amazon-after-competing-xprize-rainforest-finals).
