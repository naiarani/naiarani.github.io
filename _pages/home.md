## A Little About Me

Hello! I am a 5th year student at the Illinois Institute of Technology where I'm pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a M.S. in Autonomous Systems and Robotics. I've been able to have diverse experiences through multiple industry internships, side projects, and research experiences. I'm  looking to contribute to aerospace science and interesting robotics problems!

Currenlty, my interests lie in guidance navigation and control (GNC), robotics, remote sensing, GNSS signal processing, and astrodynamics.
