## About this

A secret hobby of mine has been art and design! I've co-designed as well as led my own multimedia art installations. I've personally designed and created two space-themed murals, one winning a Gold Pele award in 2020. I've worked on various designs for other installations as well. 

During the height of COVID-19, I picked up my hobby and turned it into freelance work! I began commissioning digital illustrations of people's friends and families, designed a line of cards, logos for organizations and political campaigns, as well as other projects. I've documented a lot of my illustrations on this [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/naiart.co/). While I am not as active in design, I am always ready to collaborate on any project!

I am fluent in the Adobe suite, especially Adobe Illustrator and InDesign.
