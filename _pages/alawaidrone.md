## A little bbout the Project

The Ala Wai Drone is a custom designed and built autonomous water sampling drone. I created 3 fully working iterations of this project, building up mechanical and way-point setting capabilities. Currently, biology researchers in Honolulu, HI use this project to remotely collect water samples in heavily polluted bodies of water, starting with the Ala Wai Canal. I submitted this project in the Google Science Fair in 2019 and won for the state of Hawaii.
